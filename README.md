YUMM1.7 tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed on day 15 after tumor implantation. Live CD45⁺ and CD45⁻ populations were sorted (BD FACS Aria Fusion Cell Sorter) and then mixed at a 9:1 ratio. Cells were processed using the Chromium GEM-X Single Cell 3′ v4 4-plex On-Chip Multiplexing (OCM) kit (10x Genomics). Final libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus using a 10B flow cell across one lane, targeting an average depth of 30,000 reads per cell, with 28 cycles for Read 1 (cell barcode and UMI), 8 cycles for i7 index, and 91 cycles for Read 2 (cDNA insert).
